# TheJoust

  This mod aims to add the good 'ole sport of Jousting to Wurm Unlimited.
  
  Features:<br>
    -A lance weapon based on the long spear,  not effective in normal combat.  Crafting can be disabled<br>
    -Skill gains for both Long Spear and Shields, can be toggled on and off<br>
    -Jousters can take some fairly brutal injuries, Armour type and QL as well as shields will all work to reduce any damage taken.<br>
    -Jousters can also have other effects take place such as being dismounted or having a helmet ripped off!<br>
    
    
From the config file....

A basic 'how to'
    
lances are made with a carving knife + log + iron sheet
lances are not considered as a weapon for normal WU combat.  A player will default to unarmed combat with a lance equipped.

in order to joust...  both parties must....
- have a jousting lance in their right hand
- have that lance selected (active, green, how ever)
- be mounted on a creature, horses usually

Jousting is dangerous, wear at least some kind of armour or you will die, alot.<br>
Armour reduction rates are as follows,  players will only take X% of the damage based on the type of armour equipped in the body location hit.
Armour QL has an additional damage reduction effect as well.  ie. excelent chain armour will be almost as good as crappy plate.<br><br>
